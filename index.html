   <p><b>HTML Semantics:</b> coding the content of a web page to give value and structure separate from the style or appearance of that content.
      Semantic code aids web accessibility and can improve search engine optimization. It also allows for easier editing or adding of page content since
      the design is created separately in the cascading style sheet.</p>
       
    <p><b>HTML Block-level</b> vs. <b>Inline-level Elements</b>: Block-level elements begin on a new line, are stacked upon one another, occupy any
      available width, and may be nested inside one another and may wrap inline-level elements. Inline-level elements are maintained within the flow of the
      document structure, are lined up one after the other, will occupy only the width of their content, and may be nested inside one another, 
      but cannot wrap block-level elements. Block-level elements are used for larger pieces of content, such as paragraphs; whereas inline-level elements
      are used with smaller pieces of content, such as a few words.</p>

    <p><b>Anchor Element:</b> The anchor element &lt;a&gt; breaks the standard inline-level element rule by specifically being able to wrap either
      block- or inline-, or any other level elements in order to enable entire blocks of content on a page to become links.</p>  

    <p><b>Relative & Absolute Paths:</b> The relative path is a link that references a page on the same website and does not include the domain
      (.com, .org, .edu, etc.) in the href attribute value; it includes only the filename of the page being linked to. If the page is located within
      a different directory or folder, the href attribute value needs to reflect this also. An example of this would be either the &lt;a href="about.html">About&lt;/a&gt;
      or &lt;a href="pages/about.html">About&lt;/a&gt;
      The absolute path is a link that references a page on a separate or another website and must include the entire url in the href attribute value,
      starting with the http and ending with the domain (.com, .org, .edu, etc.). An example would be &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/">Google&lt;/a&gt;</p>  
      
    <p><b>Structural Elements</b> are HTML5 semantic elements and tags intended to give meaning to the organization of a web page. They are all block-level 
      elements and do not have any implied position or style and can be used multiple times per page. </p>

  <p><b>Encoded Special Characters:</b> these are special characters within elements that must be encoded so they are not mistaken or misunderstood
   for the wrong character. These include various punctuation marks, accented letters, and symbols. Each encoded character will begin with 
   an ampersand & and end with a semicolon ; with the character's unique encoding, whether name or numeric, falling in between. 
   For example - &copy; is coded &amp;copy; or resum&eacute; as resum&amp;eacute;</p>
  <p><b>Meta Data Required:</b> The language and character encoding ensures proper interpretation of the HTML document and correct
   search engine indexing. The viewpoint gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. 
   These are represented respectfully in the &lt;head&gt; as  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"/&gt; and <wbr>

  <h2>Understanding Hyperlinks</h2> 
  <p>HTML Links connects a webpage to another URL address. The syntax uses the HTML &lt;a&gt; tag 
    with the attribute href (hyperlink reference), which indicates the link's destination. 
    The <i>link text</i> is visible to the reader and clicking on the link sends the reader to 
    the specified URL address.</p> 
  <p>To break down the basics:
   
    the &lt;a&gt; element is an anchor to define a hyperlink.
   
    the href attribute references the URL address to link to. If there isn't a href attribute, 
    it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.
   
    the URL address is necessary to either be absolute (links to an outside page) or relative  
    (links to a local page).
   
    The link text is the displayed text on the webpage and what is to be clicked on.
   
  <p>An example of a basic link:  
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">W3Schools.com HTML Links</a> 
  
   
  <p>By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. 
    To change this default, use the <b>target</b> attribute to specify where to open the document.
   
    The target attribute can have one of the following values: 
  <ul> 
   <li> _self - &nbsp;Default. Opens the link in the same window/tab being used.</li> 
   <li> _blank - &nbsp;Opens the link in a new window or tab.</li> 
   <li> _parent - Opens the link in the parent frame.</li> 
   <li> _top - &nbsp;Opens the link in the full body of the window.</li> 
  </ul>   
  An example of using target&#61;"_blank" to open in a new window:
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools HTML Links</a> 

  <h3>Absolute URLs</h3> 
    <p>These are links that access URLs outside the webpage and require a full web address. 
      The first bullet shows the syntax, the second what's displayed on the page.</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li> &lt;a href &#61;"https://www.avl.lib.al.us/" target&#61;"_blank"&gt;Alabama Virtual Library&lt;/a&gt; 
      <li> <a href="https://www.avl.lib.al.us/" target="_blank">Alabama Virtual Library</a></li> 
      <li> <a href="http://career.iresearchnet.com/" target="_self">Career Research</a></li> 
    </ul> 
  
  <h3>Relative URLs</h3> 
    <p> These are links that will access a local file or link within the same website and doesn't 
      use the "https://www." part. Note: the files need to be available on a server to work. 
     
      Examples of the syntax and then the displayed links are below.</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>&lt;a href&#61;"html_images.asp"&gt;HTML Images&lt;/a&gt;</li> 
      <li><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></li> 
      <li><a href="Documents\Canvas_Computer Basics Info\CBT pics\Internet of Things image by dreamstime.com.jpg"> 
        Internet of Things</a></li> 
    </ul>     

  <p><b>Link to Email:</b> To create an email link, the href attribute value needs to 
      start with <em>mailto:</em> followed by the email address to which the email should 
      be sent. For example, &lt;a href="mailto:thomasdown@strict.org"&gt;Email Me&lt;/a&gt;. 
      To include a subject line, add the <em>subject=</em> parameter after the email address. 
      Use a question mark &#63; between the email and subject parameter to bind the two; to add  
      body text, use the body= parameter in the href attribute value. To bind the two 
      parameters yet keep them separate, the ampersand &amp; is required. If using multiple  
      words within a subject line or body text, the spaces must be encoded using &#37;20; line 
      breaks must be encoded using &#37;0A or &lt;br&gt; 
      Example: &lt;a href="mailto:thomasdown@strict.org&#63;subject=More&#37;20Info&amp; 
      body=Please&#37;20tell&#37;20me&#37;20more">Email Me&lt;/a&gt;</p> 
  <p><b>Open Links in New Window:</b> To create a link that opens into a new browser window, 
      use the <i>target</i> attribute with a value of _blank. The target attribute determines 
      exactly where the link will be displayed, and the _blank value specifies a new window. 

      The code example is &lt;a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</p> 

  <p><b>Same Page Links:</b> To create a same-page link, such as "Back to top" links that return 
      a user to the top of a page, create an <em>id</em> attribute on the element you wish to link to, 
      then using the value of that <em>id</em> attribute within an anchor element's href attribute. 

      For example, to code a "back to top" link - place the id attribute of top on the &lt;body&gt; 
      element, then add #top (pound sign with value name) to link the beginning of the &lt;body&gt; 
      element. 
      &lt;body id="top"&gt; 
      &lt;a href="#top">Back to top&lt;/a&gt;</p> 

   <h3>Using an Image as a Link</h3> 
      <p>Any image or icon can be used as a link. Be sure to use the alt text to identify the link for 
        accessibility purposes. For design purposes, choose an image or icon that has meaning and relates 
        to the link's destination.
       
        An example of using an image by syntax and what's displayed:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>&lt;a href&#61;"http://career.iresearchnet.com/career-clusters/" target="_blank"&gt; 
          &lt;img src&#61;"https://www.reachabovemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/seo-topic-clusters.jpg" 
          alt&#61;"Career Clusters" style&#61;"width:150px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</li> 
        <li><a href="http://career.iresearchnet.com/career-clusters/" target="_blank"> 
          <img src="https://www.reachabovemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/seo-topic-clusters.jpg" 
           alt="Career Clusters" style="width:150px;"></a> 
      </ul>      
    </div>
  <div id="lists">
  <h2>Understanding Lists</h2>    
  <p><b>Description Listing:</b> An online list used to outline multiple terms and their descriptions. 
       It is a block-level element using the tag &lt;dl&gt; and two elements: &lt;dt&gt; to describe 
       the term and &lt;dd&gt; to define the term. By default, the &lt;dl&gt; element will include vertical 
       margins with a left margin for the &lt;dd&gt; element.
 
       Example of this follows:</p> 
  <dl> 
	  <dt><b>Unordered List</b></dt> 
      <dd>A listing of related terms whose order does not matter. To create an unordered list, 
           use the &lt;ul&gt; element with each list item marked symbolically with the &lt;li&gt; element.</dd> 
    
    <dt><b>Ordered Lists</b></dt> 
      <dd>A listing of terms whose presentation of order is important. To create an ordered list, 
           use the &lt;ol&gt; element with each item marked numerically with the &lt;li&gt; element.</dd> 
  </dl>  
  <p>Ordered lists have two attributes available for use - start and reversed. Start attribute defines the
    number from which an ordered list should start; by default, the list starts at 1. When using the <i>start</i>
    attribute on the &lt;ol&gt; element, you can identify exactly what number the ordered list will begin counting
    from; it uses only integer values. For example: &lt;ol start="20"&gt;<br>
    The reverse attribute allows a list to appear in reverse order. It is a Boolean attribute- it accepts only true
    or false, with False as the default value. When the attribute <i>reversed</i> appears in the &lt;ol&gt; element,
    the value becomes True. For example: &lt;ol reversed&gt;
  </p>  </div>
  <br>
  <div id="images"> 
  <h2>Understanding Images</h2>
  <p><b>Adding Images:</b> Images can be added to a page using the &lt;img&gt; inline element. It is self-containing,
    so it doesn't wrap any other content and exists as a single tag. For the &lt;img&gt; element to work, a src attribute
    and value must be included to specify the source of the image; typically the <i>src</i> attribute is a URL. 
    In addition to the src attribute is the <i>alt</i> or alternate text attribute to describe the image for web 
    accessibility and SEO purposes. Supported online image file formats include jpg, gif, and png; with jpg and png being 
    the most widely used. <br>
    Code format example: &lt;img src=https://www.ferialyouakim.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AdobeStock_85718241.jpg"
     alt="sunflower in field with blue sky background"&gt; 
    </p>
    <p>When adding images, it is helpful to size the image to fit appropriately on the page. One way is to resize the 
      actual file using an editor; this can be done only for local files, not web images. The second, more effective way, 
      is to use the width and height attributes for the image tag. When using only the width attribute in pixels, the browser
      will adjust the height so it stays proportional to the width. When opting to create a specific size for the image to fit,
      use both the width and height attribute. Lastly, using a percentage of the image size or container will resize to that
      percentage- for example, width=50&#37; reduces the image to 50&#37; of what it should be, not the original picture size.
    </p>
  
<p>Images are not technically inserted into a web page, they are linked to web pages.  
  The &lt;img&gt; element creates a container for the referenced image. Alone it is empty, it 
  must contain attributes - specifically the <em>src</em> and <em>alt</em>. The src attribute specifies the path 
  to the image and the alt specifies an alternate text for the image.
 
  The URL path is requested by the browser at the time the web page loads and inserts the image. 
  If the browser cannot locate the image source, the broken link icon and the alt text are shown. 

 
  Another attribute that's helpful is the either the style attribute to specify the width and/or 
  height of an image, or the individual width and height attributes. The style attribute requires 
  the format use of either pixels or percentage; the width/height attribute is pixels. It is 
  advised to use the style attribute to prevent the styles sheets from potentially changing it.
 
  If the image file is large, it may take time to load. A good practice is to set the style  
  width and height to prevent the web page from flickering while the image loads.</p> 
<p><strong>Image floating</strong> allows an image to float either to the right or to the left of a text. This is 
  added to the style attribute. An example of the syntax:
 
  To float right of the text:  &lt;img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/57/115657-004-1C7267FE/St-Augustine-Canterbury-Abbey-England-Kent.jpg" 
  alt="Abby in Kent, England" style="float:right; width:80px;height:70px;"&gt; 
 
  To float left of the text:  &lt;img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/57/115657-004-1C7267FE/St-Augustine-Canterbury-Abbey-England-Kent.jpg" 
  alt="Abby in Kent, England" style="float:left; width:80px;height:70px;"&gt;</p> 
<p><b>To float right of the text: </b> <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/57/115657-004-1C7267FE/St-Augustine-Canterbury-Abbey-England-Kent.jpg" 
  alt="Abby in Kent, England" style="float:right; width:80px;height:70px;"></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>To float left of the text:</b>  <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/57/115657-004-1C7267FE/St-Augustine-Canterbury-Abbey-England-Kent.jpg" 
  alt="Abby in Kent, England" style="float:left; width:80px;height:70px;"></p> <br>
  <br>

 <h3>Using &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; elements for images</h3> 
<p>The &lt;figure&gt; element allows for the mark up of a image in a document; a &lt;figcaption&gt; element 
   defines the caption of the image. You can use CSS to style &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt;. 
   Here's an example of its use:
 
   <p>Views in Canterbury, Kent are beautiful and quaint</p> 
   <figure> 
   <img src="https://s19623.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/weekend-in-canterbury.jpg"  
    alt="Bridge connecting Canterbury village to the Abbey" style="width:20%"> 
   <figcaption>Fig.1 - A bridge in Canterbury, Kent, England.</figcaption> 
   </figure> 

 
<h3>Creating an Image Map</h3> 
<p>An <strong>Image Map</strong> creates clickable areas on an image. It is defined by the 
    &lt;map&gt; tag. To begine the creation of a clickable image, you use the &lt;img&gt; tag 
    with the attribute <em>usemap</em>, whose value starts with a hash tag &#35; followed by the name of the image 
    map; this is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.
 
    An example is &lt;img scr=https://o.quizlet.com/NNq5-Elv2O1XuSir4tADZg_b.png" alt="Parts of 
    a computer" usemap="&#35;computerparts"&gt;</p> 
<p>To create the image map, use the &lt;map&gt; element with the <em>name</em> attribute equal 
   to the created <em>usemap</em> attribute in the &lt;img&gt; tag. Then add the clickable areas 
   using the &lt;area&gt; element to define the shape and coordinates of the area available to 
   be clickable. The Shape of the area must be defined using one of the following values:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li><strong>rect</strong> - defines a rectangular region</li> 
  <li><strong>circle</strong> - defines a circular region</li> 
  <li><strong>poly</strong> - defines a polygonal region</li> 
  <li><strong>default</strong> - defines the entire region</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The coordinates for each shape come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis. Each 
   shape has a formula for determining these coordinates.
 
<ul> 
  <li><strong>shape="rect"</strong> coordinate starts at the top left corner X,Y of the area and then the bottom right 
   corner X,Y so that (34,44,270,350) equals 34px from left margin,44px from top,270px from 
   left margin,350px from top.</li> 
  <li><strong>shape="circle" </strong>coordinate starts at the center of the circle area X,Y and then specifies the  
   radius X of the circle so that (337,300,44) equals 337px from left margin,300px from top 
   is the center and 44px is the radius.</li> 
  <li><strong>shape="poly"</strong> coordinates has several X,Y points which custom creates a shape formed with  
   straight lines that conforms to any image. The multiple coordinate pairs are determined 
   by outlining the shape using the left margin (X) and top margin (Y) for all edges. 
 
   a poly coordinate example is (140,121,103,161,40,259,37,322,85,355,191,270,204,160,181,116) 
   which desinates an oblong shape of a croissant.</li> 
 </ul>

 <h2>Understanding Audio</h2>   
  <p><b>Adding Audio:</b> Audio files can be added to a page using the &lt;audio&gt; inline element. Like the 
    &lt;img&gt; element, the &lt;audio&gt; element uses the src attribute with a source URL; however it requires an
    opening and closing tag. Basic example: &lt;audio src="https://youtu.be/_LVfsrS7fUk"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
    There are several Audio attributes available, the first 3 are Boolean attributes set to True when present.
    The following below are the most commonly used attributes:</p>  
    <dl>
      <dt><b>autoplay</b></dt>
      <dd>A Boolean attribute that will automatically play an audio file upon loading.
        &lt;audio src="https://youtu.be/_LVfsrS7fUk" autoplay&gt;&lt;audio&gt;</dd>
      <dt><b>controls</b></dt>
      <dd>A Boolean attribute that will display the audio controls on a page, including play and pause, seek, and 
         volume controls. &lt;audio src="https://youtu.be/_LVfsrS7fUk" controls&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</dd>
      <dt><b>loop</b></dt>   
      <dd>A Boolean attribute that will cause an audio file to repeat continually, from beginning to end.
        &lt;audio src="https://youtu.be/_LVfsrS7fUk" loop&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</dd>
      <dt><b>preload</b></dt>  
      <dd>An attribute that helps identify what, if any, information about the audio file should be loaded before 
        the clip is played. It accepts three values: none, auto, and metadata. The <em>none</em> value won't preload
        any information about the file, while the <em>auto</em> value will preload all information about the file.
        The <em>metadata</em> value will preload any available metadata information, but not all the information. 
        When the preload attribute isn't present on the &lt;audio&gt; element, all information is loaded as if set to 
        auto; therefore a good practice is to use the metadata or none when the audio file isn't essential to a page.</dd>
    </dl><br>

<div id="tables">
  <h2>Understanding Tables</h2>
    <p><b>Creating Tables:</b> HTML tables provide a straightforward way to mark up structured tabular data 
      and to display that data in a form that is easy to read and digest. The table data is contained 
      within columns and rows; at minimum a table consists of the &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt; (table row), 
      and &lt;td&gt; (table data) elements. For greater structure and additional semantic value, tables 
      may include the &lt;th&gt; (table header) element.</p> 
    <p><b>Structured elements of a table</b> <br>
 
       &lt;table&gt; Table element initializes a table on a page <br>
 
       &lt;tr&gt; Table Row element initiates the row on a page; numberous rows can be added<br>
 
       &lt;td&gt; Table Data element displays the data included in the row; each &lt;td&gt; element 
           listed one after the other will create columns within a table row<br>
 
       &lt;/td&gt; required closing tag added at the end of each data element<br>
 
       &lt;/tr&gt; required closing tag added to close the Table Row element<br>
 
       &lt;/table&gt; required closing tag added to close the Table element </p> 

     <p><b>Table Header</b> is used to designate a heading for a column or rows of cells. 
       The &lt;th&gt; element creates a cell for data and adds semantic value to the content. 
       Table headers may be used within both columns and rows; the <em>scope</em> attribute helps  
       identify exactly what content a table header relates to and is indicated with the values 
       <i>col</i> (all cells within the column) <i>row</i>, (all cells within the row),  
       <i>colgroup</i>, and <i>rowgroup</i>. The first two are most commonly used, an example is
        &lt;th scope="col"&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Utilities&lt;/th&gt;</p> 

      <p><b>Table Caption:</b> A caption helps users identify what the table pertains to and what 
        data to expect within it. The &lt;caption&gt; element must come immediately after the opening 
        &lt;table&gt; tag, and it is positioned at the top of a table by default.</p> 

      <p><b>Table Head, Body & Foot:</b> The content within tables can be broken up into multiple 
       groups, including a head, a body, and a foot. The &lt;thead&gt; (table head) wraps the heading 
       row or rows of a table to denote the head; it's placed at the top of a table, after any  
       &lt;caption&gt; element and before any &lt;tbody&gt; element. The &lt;tbody&gt; element contains 
       the primary data within a table; it's place after the &lt;thead&gt; element. The &lt;tfoot&gt; 
       element contains data that outlines the contents of a table; it's placed after the &lt;thead&gt; 
       element, but either before or after the &lt;tbody&gt; element.</p> 

      <p><b>Combining Multiple Cells:</b> When two or more cells need to be merged into one without 
       breaking the overall row or column layout, use the <em>colspan</em> and <em>rowspan</em> attributes. 
       These two attributes work on either the &lt;td&gt; or &lt;th&gt; elements. The colspan attribute 
       merges a single cell across multiple columns within a table; while the rowspan attribute is 
       used to merge a single cell across multiple rows. Each attribute accepts an integer value that  
       indicates the number of cells to merge, with 1 being the default value. 
       Examples include: &lt;th scope="col" colspan="3"&gt;Item description&lt;/th&gt; or  
        &lt;td colspan="4"&gt;Cost&lt;/td&gt;</p>
